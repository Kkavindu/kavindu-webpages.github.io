Carried out two projects as a Research Assistant and a Master of Science student at Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department of Clarkson University.

Project 1
======

 - Automated In-Situ Testing System: Designed a patent-pending, fully automated, micro-tensile testing setup with a 3-axis motorized stage, precision stepper motors, and integrated software for feature tracking, autofocus, and image processing. This system achieves high-resolution imaging at multiple magnifications, allowing real-time analysis in less than 8.5 minutes.

Project 2
======

 - Deep Learning for Microscopic Strain Measurement: Developed a deep learning-based framework to segment and track microstructural features in in-situ micro-tensile videos, enhancing accuracy in local strain measurement.
