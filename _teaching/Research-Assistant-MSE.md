Carried out several projects as a Research Assistant and a Doctor of Philosophy student at the Materials Science & Engineering Department of Clarkson University.

Project 1
======

 - Hierarchical Deformation in Anisotropic Alloys: Led in-depth characterization of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V, employing SEM, EBSD, Optical Microscopy, and XRD. Through in-situ SEM micro-tensile testing, identified and described deformation mechanisms, introducing a novel intergranular compatibility theory to explain strength anisotropy.

Project 2
======

 - Boron-Enhanced Alloy Design: Engineered multi-walled Ti-6Al-4V alloys with various boron compositions for optimal tensile behavior. Conducted uniaxial tensile testing in multiple orientations, discovering an ideal 0.05 wt.% boron concentration to achieve isotropic tensile properties.

Project 3
======

 - Residual Stress Measurement and Heat Treatment: Measured residual stresses in Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg using strain gauges, and performed heat treatments on DED SS 316L, DED Ti-6Al-4V, and SLM Inconel 718 to enhance alloy performance.

Project 4
======

 - Generative AI for Virtual Tensile Testing: Currently developing an AI framework with latent diffusion modeling to predict deformation up to 20% strain in solution-annealed SS 316L, enabling virtual material testing.
