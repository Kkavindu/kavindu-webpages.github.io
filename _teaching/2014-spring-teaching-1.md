As the founder of 3D Mart, I offered custom 3D printing and engineering services, handling everything from 3D modeling to advanced simulations like Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Using a Creality Ender 3 printer, I provided rapid prototyping solutions tailored to client needs, delivering high-quality and precise models for a variety of applications.
