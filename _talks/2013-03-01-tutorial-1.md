The microstructure-informed design approach is set to revolutionize the design of metals and alloy
components. In this approach, a designer utilizes the influence of individual microstructural features on
microscopic deformation to yield desirable macroscopic properties. Therefore, the development of
advanced experimental capabilities that enable detailed characterization of microscopic deformation of
material test specimens is critical to realize this paradigm shift in practice. However, extracting the
complex characteristics of microscopic deformation hidden in raw image data is quite challenging. We
propose an automated data extraction and analysis method based on instance segmentation and tracking
of microstructural features using deep learning and image processing algorithms.
