title: "Methods and apparatus for a mechanical testing system to characterize the heterogeneous deformation at microscale"
excerpt: "A 3-axis motorized stage integrated with precision stepper motors to support a 1000 lb micro-tensile tester positioned above an inverted optical microscope. Developed automation software using C++ (Arduino) and Python for feature tracking, autofocus, panoramic imaging, and post-processing (focus stacking and stabilization). The system captures high-resolution microscopic deformation (5X, 10X, 20X magnification) of metal coupon specimens in under 8.5 minutes (Patent pending)."
