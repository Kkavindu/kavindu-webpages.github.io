As a Research Assistant and Ph.D. Candidate at Clarkson University, I have dedicated my efforts to advancing the understanding of the process-structure-property relationships in additively manufactured high-performance alloys. My research employs a combination of experimental methods and data-driven approaches, spanning the design of novel alloys to the development of innovative tools that elevate the standards of conventional materials characterization. This work bridges materials science with cutting-edge computer vision technologies.

During my time at Clarkson, I have had the privilege of contributing to several impactful projects in the field of Materials Science and Engineering, with my findings published in Q1 journals. Key projects include:

 - Investigating deformation mechanisms influenced by microstructural features that result in anisotropic mechanical properties of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V.
 - Designing boron-modified DED Ti-6Al-4V alloys for enhanced tensile performance by identifying the optimal boron composition and analyzing the microstructural and deformation mechanisms driving the observed behavior.
 - Precisely measuring residual stresses in SLM (Selective Laser Melting) builds.
 - Predicting material deformation using physics-informed generative AI.
 
These projects highlight a commitment to improving alloy performance and reliability in advanced manufacturing applications, emphasizing both practical innovation and scientific rigor.

Investigating the deformation mechanisms driving the anisotropic mechanical properties of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V
======
Hierarchical Deformation in Anisotropic Alloys: Led in-depth characterization of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V, employing SEM, EBSD, Optical Microscopy, and XRD. Through in-situ SEM micro-tensile testing, deformation mechanisms were identified and described, and a novel intergranular compatibility theory was introduced to explain strength anisotropy.

Project 2
======
Boron-Enhanced Alloy Design: Engineered multi-walled Ti-6Al-4V alloys with various boron compositions for optimal tensile behavior. Conducted uniaxial tensile testing in multiple orientations, discovering an ideal 0.05 wt.% boron concentration to achieve isotropic tensile properties.

Project 3
======

Residual Stress Measurement: To validate computational predictions, residual stress values were measured using the separation method (Separated the block from the build plate using a band saw) on a Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg four-walled build. The measurements were made using 8 uniaxial 350-ohm strain gauges (HBK) mounted on 3 outer walls to measure horizontal and vertical strains.

I used two DAQ devices (National Instruments (NI) 6211 and NI 9184) and NI LabView software for data logging.

Project 4
======
Generative AI for Virtual Tensile Testing: Currently developing an AI framework with latent diffusion modeling to predict deformation up to 20% strain in solution-annealed SS 316L, enabling virtual material testing.

Measured residual stresses in Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg using strain gauges, and performed heat treatments on DED SS 316L, DED Ti-6Al-4V, and SLM Inconel 718 to enhance alloy performance.
