Project 1
======
Hierarchical Deformation in Anisotropic Alloys: Led in-depth characterization of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V, employing SEM, EBSD, Optical Microscopy, and XRD. Through in-situ SEM micro-tensile testing, identified and described deformation mechanisms, introducing a novel intergranular compatibility theory to explain strength anisotropy.

Project 2
======
Boron-Enhanced Alloy Design: Engineered multi-walled Ti-6Al-4V alloys with various boron compositions for optimal tensile behavior. Conducted uniaxial tensile testing in multiple orientations, discovering an ideal 0.05 wt.% boron concentration to achieve isotropic tensile properties.

Project 3
======
Residual Stress Measurement: To validate computational predictions, residual stress values were measured using the separation method (Separated the block from the build plate using a band saw) on a Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg four-walled build. The measurements were made using 8 uniaxial 350-ohm strain gauges (HBK) mounted on 3 outer walls to measure horizontal and vertical strains.

I used two DAQ devices (National Instruments (NI) 6211 and NI 9184) and NI LabView software for data logging.

Project 4
======
Generative AI for Virtual Tensile Testing: Currently developing an AI framework with latent diffusion modeling to predict deformation up to 20% strain in solution-annealed SS 316L, enabling virtual material testing.

Heat Treatment: Measured residual stresses in Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg using strain gauges, and performed heat treatments on DED SS 316L, DED Ti-6Al-4V, and SLM Inconel 718 to enhance alloy performance.
