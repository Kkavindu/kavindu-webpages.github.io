Understanding mechanical behavior at both macroscopic and
microscopic scales is
crucial for analyzing structural performance and designing advanced alloys.

Traditional in-situ tensile testing, while effective in capturing
microstructure-influenced deformation, is time-consuming and requires high
expertise. To address this, we introduce a Deep Learning (DL) assisted
virtual
in-situ tensile testing system that predicts deformation behavior from
microstructures. This adaptable framework enables rapid and accurate
characterization of new material. Our system uses a high-throughput in-situ

tensile testing device for capturing the training data. To reduce data
complexity and minimize the need for extensive training data, we use
dynamic
mode decomposition, retaining crucial information for accurate predictions.
The
system utilizes comprehensive input data on undeformed microstructures and
potential deformation mechanisms to predict the deformation and evolution
of
grain and sub-grain features. This approach advances materials science
research
by providing a robust method for understanding microstructural behavior
under
tensile conditions, expediting next-generation alloy development.
