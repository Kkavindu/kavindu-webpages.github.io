I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at Clarkson University, specializing in materials science and engineering with a focus on advancing the mechanical properties of additively manufactured alloys. My research explores the Process-Structure-Property relationship in titanium-based alloys and other materials for optimized applications in aerospace and advanced manufacturing. I leverage deep learning, automation, and in-situ characterization to uncover the deformation mechanisms that enhance material performance under various conditions.

Research Focus
======
My work centers on:

1. Microstructural and Mechanical Characterization: Investigating hierarchical deformation mechanisms in directed energy deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V alloys using advanced tools like SEM, EBSD, XRD, and digital image correlation (DIC).
2. Alloy Design: Optimizing the tensile behavior of Ti-6Al-4V through trace boron additions, identifying the ideal concentrations for improved isotropy and enhanced strength.
3. Generative AI in Materials Science: Developing AI-driven models for predicting material deformation, enabling virtual testing and accelerating the design of advanced materials.
4. Automated Testing Systems: Designing a patent-pending, fully automated micro-tensile testing system for real-time strain measurement and microstructural analysis, capable of high-resolution imaging and advanced feature tracking.

Technical Expertise
======
With a strong foundation in both experimental and computational methods, I bring expertise in:

1. Material Characterization: SEM, OM, EBSD, XRD, and nanoindentation.
2. Additive Manufacturing & Heat Treatments: Experience with selective laser melting (SLM) and directed energy deposition (DED) for alloy development.
3. Automation & Robotics: Skilled in microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) for customized automation solutions in materials testing.
4. Deep Learning & Computer Vision: Developing deep learning models for strain measurement and feature tracking, with proficiency in Python and MATLAB.
