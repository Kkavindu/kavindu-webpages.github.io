title: "Methods and apparatus for a mechanical testing system to characterize the heterogeneous deformation at microscale (Pending patent)"
excerpt: "This pending patent involves a high-precision, 3-axis motorized stage integrated with stepper motors, supporting a 1000 lb micro-tensile tester positioned above an inverted optical microscope. The system enables the capture of high-resolution images (5X, 10X, 20X magnification) of metal coupon specimens, recording microscopic deformation in under 8.5 minutes.
Automation software developed in C++ (Arduino) and Python provides advanced functionality, including feature tracking, autofocus, panoramic imaging, and post-processing enhancements such as focus stacking and image stabilization. This setup allows for rapid, precise analysis of heterogeneous deformation across complex microstructures.
