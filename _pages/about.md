## About


üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at Clarkson University, specializing in materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer vision, with a focus on accelerating material design through AI and automation.

![DALL-E](images/DALLE2.png){: align="right" width="280px"}
üî¨ My research aims to transform materials science by streamlining the Process-Structure-Property relationship in titanium alloys and other advanced materials for aerospace and high-performance manufacturing applications. I bring hands-on experience in experimental characterization, understanding how time-consuming, costly, and variable these processes can be. With this background, I am driven to develop AI-driven methods and automated systems that enhance efficiency, consistency, and insight in material design, paving the way for precision-tailored properties under diverse testing conditions.

## üßê Research Focus

My research integrates advanced experimental techniques with AI and automation to drive material innovation. Key areas include:

 - Microstructural and Mechanical Characterization
With extensive experience in designing and performing complex tests, including in-situ SEM, I investigate mechanical properties, microstructure, and deformation mechanisms in additively manufactured (AM) aerospace alloys. My work utilizes advanced characterization tools, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscopy (OM), In-situ/Ex-situ SEM/OM, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Nanoindentation, Uniaxial Tensile Testing, and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). These experiments deepen the structure-property relationship understanding and have led to publications in top-tier journals.

 - Alloy Design through Microstructural Manipulation
By incorporating trace elements into AM alloys, I explore optimal concentrations to enhance mechanical properties. This approach enables precision-engineered material properties through careful manipulation of microstructure.

 - High-Throughput Testing System Design
I design fully automated testing systems capable of real-time, high-resolution, and high-throughput experiments, allowing for rapid data collection in advanced materials testing. These systems support the efficient and scalable collection of experimental data, driving faster material development cycles.

 - AI-Driven Material Data Analysis
I develop AI tools for rapid, high-accuracy analysis of experimental data, particularly in-situ deformation data, which reduces analysis time, enhances repeatability, and lessens the dependency on manual interpretation. These tools allow efficient data handling, supporting consistent insights from complex material behaviors.

 - Generative AI for Virtual Testing
I develop generative AI models, including Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), that predict the deformation behavior of experimentally observed microstructures under simulated conditions. This virtual testing capability accelerates material design iterations by providing a cost-effective method to explore material behavior across various conditions before or by completely replacing physical testing.

## ‚ú® Technical Expertise

With a strong foundation in experimental and data-driven techniques, I bring expertise across the following areas:

### Material Characterization
 - I am skilled in advanced characterization techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscopy (OM), In-situ/Ex-situ SEM/OM, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Nanoindentation, and Uniaxial Tensile Testing. My experience extends to metallic sample preparation (mechanical & electro-chemical polishing/etching), Digital Image Correlation (DIC), surface roughness measurement, heat treatment, and residual stress measurement using strain gages.

### Manufacturing Techniques
 - I have hands-on experience with advanced and traditional manufacturing methods, including Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of stainless steel 316L, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) of polymers (PLA), and manual machining (lathe, milling, and drilling). Additionally, I am skilled in CNC programming, arc welding, laser cutting, and soldering, providing a comprehensive manufacturing background.

### Automation & Robotics
 - I design and implement custom automation solutions in materials testing and industrial settings, with expertise in microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) and Siemens PLC systems. My automation solutions support high-precision and high-throughput testing, integral to accelerating the iterative design process.

### Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence
 - With proficiency in Python and MATLAB, I specialize in deep learning applications (predictive and generative AI), object detection, segmentation, feature tracking, and algorithm development. My work includes video stabilization, focus stacking, image enhancement, optical flow mapping, and feature extraction, contributing to efficient and accurate data interpretation in experimental material studies.
