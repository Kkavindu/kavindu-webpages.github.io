Tensile tests conducted on specimens of direct energy deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V loaded parallel to the build direction revealed lower strength and higher elongation than for the specimens loaded perpendicular to the build direction. To determine the factors responsible for this anisotropic behavior we conducted a comprehensive experimental investigation. The investigation primarily relied on identifying and characterizing various deformation mechanisms at microscopic length scale. Microstructural analysis, employing scanning electron microscopy and digital image correlation, coupled with electron backscattered diffraction, unveiled the grain texture and intricate deformation mechanisms encompassing slip systems, shear bands, and strain localization bands. The insights gained are expected to offer valuable guidelines for optimizing DED parameters in additive manufacturing applications. Moreover, this research establishes a foundation for future studies in the development of plasticity-based constitutive models to predict microscopic deformation.
