## Overview
üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Clarkson University, specializing in mechanical engineering, metallurgy, and artificial intelligence. My work integrates advanced material characterization, deep learning-based tools, and automated systems to address challenges in metal additive manufacturing.

I focus on exploring Process-Structure-Property relationships to enhance material performance, particularly for cutting-edge applications in aerospace and advanced manufacturing industries.

## Research Focus
1. Deformation Mechanisms in Additive Manufacturing
Investigated materials like Ti-6Al-4V, boron-modified Ti-6Al-4V, and stainless steel 316L.
Utilized advanced techniques: SEM, EBSD, EDS, XRD, AFM, optical microscopy, and in-situ tensile testing.
2. AI-Driven Innovations for Material Design
Developed deep learning tools for:
Strain measurement through feature segmentation and tracking.
Predicting material deformation with latent video diffusion models.
3. Automated Micro-Tensile Testing Systems
Designed a patent-pending micro-tensile testing system for real-time strain measurement and high-resolution microstructural analysis.
4. Structure-Property Relationships
Established the relationships between alloy composition, microstructure, and mechanical behavior under various loading conditions.

## ‚ú® Technical Expertise

With a strong foundation in experimental and data-driven techniques, I bring expertise across the following areas:

### Material Characterization
 - I am skilled in advanced characterization techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Optical Microscopy (OM), In-situ/Ex-situ SEM/OM, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Nanoindentation, and Uniaxial Tensile Testing. My experience extends to metallic sample preparation (mechanical & electro-chemical polishing/etching), Digital Image Correlation (DIC), surface roughness measurement, heat treatment, and residual stress measurement using strain gages.

### Manufacturing Techniques
 - I have hands-on experience with advanced and traditional manufacturing methods, including Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of stainless steel 316L, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) of polymers (PLA), and manual machining (lathe, milling, and drilling). Additionally, I am skilled in CNC programming, arc welding, laser cutting, and soldering, providing a comprehensive manufacturing background.

### Automation & Robotics
 - I design and implement custom automation solutions in materials testing and industrial settings, with expertise in microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) and Siemens PLC systems. My automation solutions support high-precision and high-throughput testing, integral to accelerating the iterative design process.

### Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence
 - With proficiency in Python and MATLAB, I specialize in deep learning applications (predictive and generative AI), object detection, segmentation, feature tracking, and algorithm development. My work includes video stabilization, focus stacking, image enhancement, optical flow mapping, and feature extraction, contributing to efficient and accurate data interpretation in experimental material studies.
