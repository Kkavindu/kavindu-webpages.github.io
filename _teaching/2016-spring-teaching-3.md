As a Mechanical Engineer in the UAV Laboratory at the University of Moratuwa, I led the design and prototyping of Mora-X, a quadcopter tailored for aerial mapping. This project emphasized optimizing aerodynamics and weight distribution using advanced topology optimization techniques in SolidWorks, Ansys, and Fusion360. The work underscored a focus on precision engineering to enhance UAV performance in real-world applications.
