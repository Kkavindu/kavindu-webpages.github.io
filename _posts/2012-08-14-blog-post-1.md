### Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY
Research Assistant | January 2020 – April 2025

 - Hierarchical Deformation in Anisotropic Alloys: Led in-depth characterization of Directed Energy Deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V, employing SEM, EBSD, Optical Microscopy, and XRD. Through in-situ SEM micro-tensile testing, identified and described deformation mechanisms, introducing a novel intergranular compatibility theory to explain strength anisotropy.

 - Boron-Enhanced Alloy Design: Engineered multi-walled Ti-6Al-4V alloys with various boron compositions for optimal tensile behavior. Conducted uniaxial tensile testing in multiple orientations, discovering an ideal 0.05 wt.% boron concentration to achieve isotropic tensile properties.

 - Automated In-Situ Testing System: Designed a patent-pending, fully automated, micro-tensile testing setup with a 3-axis motorized stage, precision stepper motors, and integrated software for feature tracking, autofocus, and image processing. This system achieves high-resolution imaging at multiple magnifications, allowing real-time analysis in less than 8.5 minutes.

 - Residual Stress Measurement and Heat Treatment: Measured residual stresses in Selective Laser Melted (SLM) AlSi10Mg using strain gauges, and performed heat treatments on DED SS 316L, DED Ti-6Al-4V, and SLM Inconel 718 to enhance alloy performance.

 - Deep Learning for Microscopic Strain Measurement: Developed a deep learning-based framework to segment and track microstructural features in in-situ micro-tensile videos, enhancing accuracy in local strain measurement.

 - Generative AI for Virtual Tensile Testing: Currently developing an AI framework with latent diffusion modeling to predict deformation up to 20% strain in solution-annealed SS 316L, enabling virtual material testing.

### AHEAD UAV Laboratory (Startup), Colombo, Sri Lanka
Chief Mechanical Engineer | January 2019 – December 2019

 - Designed and prototyped a quadcopter (Mora-X) for aerial mapping, optimizing aerodynamics and weight distribution through topology optimization using SolidWorks, Ansys, and Fusion360.

### Camso Loadstar Pvt. Ltd. – Wheel Manufacturing Division, Ekala, Sri Lanka
Mechanical Engineering Intern | June 2017 – December 2016

 - Developed an automated tire runout checking device with pneumatic actuation to enhance quality control within the tire assembly process, integrating automation within the production line.

### 3DMart 3D Printing Service & Freelance Engineering, Colombo, Sri Lanka
Self-Employed & Freelancer | April 2018 – December 2019

 - Provided custom 3D printing and engineering services, including 3D modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations for clients. Utilized a Creality Ender 3 printer for rapid prototyping of customer-requested designs.
