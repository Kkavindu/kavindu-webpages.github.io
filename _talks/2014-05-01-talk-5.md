The development of a hierarchical microstructure-informed crystal plasticity-based constitutive model for directed energy deposited (DED) Ti6Al4V is discussed. DED Ti6Al4V often exhibits a Widmanstätten microstructure, which is a dual-phase microstructure consisting of alpha and beta palates in a beta matrix arranged in colonies within grains. In addition, the microstructure also consists of grain boundary alpha surrounding the grains. The developed microstructure-informed constitutive model accounts for the geometric and mechanistic effects of the Widmanstätten microstructure and grain boundary alpha by explicitly considering these features in a 3D representative microstructure. Homogenization schemes are developed to effectively implement the constitutive model on a finite element analysis (FEA) framework. The anisotropy is realized as a natural outcome of a preferred alignment of alpha and beta palates inside colonies with respect to the build direction. The model is experimentally validated by obtaining the stress-strain behaviors in both the build and scan directions.
