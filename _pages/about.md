I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at Clarkson University, specializing in materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer vision, with a focus on enhancing the mechanical properties of additively manufactured alloys. My research explores the Process-Structure-Property relationship in titanium alloys and other advanced materials for optimized applications in aerospace and high-performance manufacturing. By uncovering the underlying deformation mechanisms, I aim to leverage this understanding to inform material design, manipulating microstructures to achieve superior performance under diverse testing conditions.

Research Focus
======
My research focuses on the following areas:

1. Microstructural and Mechanical Characterization: Investigating hierarchical deformation mechanisms in directed energy deposited (DED) Ti-6Al-4V alloys. I utilize advanced characterization tools such as SEM, EBSD, XRD, and digital image correlation (DIC) to gain insights into microstructural evolution and mechanical response.
2. Alloy Design through Microstructural Manipulation: Optimizing the tensile behavior of Ti-6Al-4V by fine-tuning boron additions, identifying ideal trace concentrations that enhance isotropy and strength. This approach enables tailored material properties by precisely controlling microstructure.
3. AI-Driven Generative Modeling for Materials Science: Developing generative AI models to predict material deformation, facilitating virtual testing, and accelerating the iterative design of advanced materials by simulating behavior under various conditions.
4. Automated In-situ Testing Systems: Designing a patent-pending, fully automated micro-tensile testing system equipped for real-time, high-resolution strain measurement and microstructural analysis. This system leverages deep learning for advanced feature segmentation and tracking and enables rapid, data-driven insights into local strain behavior and deformation mechanisms.

2. Manufacturing: Experience with Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of stainless steel 316L, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) of polymers (PLA), Manual machining (Lathe/Milling/Drilling), Arc welding, CNC programming, Laser cutting, and Soldering
3. Automation & Robotics: Skilled in microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) for customized automation solutions in materials testing and industrial automation using Siemens PLC.
